        In computing, logging is the act of keeping a log of events that occur in a computer system, such as problems, errors or
        just information on current operations. These events may occur in the operating system or in other software. A message
        or log entry is recorded for each such event. These log messages can then be used to monitor and understand the
        operation of the system, to debug problems, or during an audit. Logging is particularly important in multi-user
        software, to have a central overview of the operation of the system.
        
        In the simplest case, messages are written to a file, called a log file.[1] Alternatively, the messages may be written
        to a dedicated logging system or to a log management software, where it is stored in a database or on a different
        computer system.
        
        Specifically, a transaction log is a log of the communications between a system and the users of that system,[2] or a
        data collection method that automatically captures the type, content, or time of transactions made by a person from a
        terminal with that system.[3] For Web searching, a transaction log is an electronic record of interactions that have
        occurred during a searching episode between a Web search engine and users searching for information on that Web search
        engine.
        
        Many operating systems, software frameworks and programs include a logging system. A widely used logging standard is
        Syslog, defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 5424). The Syslog standard enables a dedicated,
        standardized subsystem to generate, filter, record, and analyze log messages. This relieves software developers of
        having to design and code their ad hoc logging systems.[4][5][6]
        Types
        Event logs
        
        Event logs record events taking place in the execution of a system in order to provide. That can be used to understand
        the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. They are essential to understand particularly in the case of
        applications with little user interaction.
        
        It can also be useful to combine log file entries from multiple sources. It is a different combination that may yield
        between with related events on different servers. Other solutions employ network-wide querying and reporting.[7][8]
        Transaction logs
        Main article: Transaction log
        
        Most database systems maintain some kind of transaction log, which are not mainly intended as an audit trail for later
        analysis, and are not intended to be human-readable. These logs record changes to the stored data to allow the database
        to recover from crashes or other data errors and maintain the stored data in a consistent state. Thus, database systems
        usually have both general event logs and transaction logs.[9][10][11][12]
        
        The use of data stored in transaction logs of Web search engines, Intranets, and Web sites can provide valuable insight
        into understanding the information-searching process of online searchers.[13] This understanding can enlighten
        information system design, interface development, and devising the information architecture for content collections.
        Message logs
        
        Internet Relay Chat (IRC), instant messaging (IM) programs, peer-to-peer file sharing clients with chat functions, and
        multiplayer games (especially MMORPGs) commonly have the ability to automatically save textual communication, both
        public (IRC channel/IM conference/MMO public/party chat messages) and private chat between users, as message logs.[14]
        Message logs are almost universally plain text files, but IM and VoIP clients (which support textual chat, e.g. Skype)
        might save them in HTML files or in a custom format to ease reading or enable encryption.
        
        In the case of IRC software, message logs often include system/server messages and entries related to channel and user
        changes (e.g. topic change, user joins/exits/kicks/bans, nickname changes, the user status changes), making them more
        like a combined message/event log of the channel in question, but such a log is not comparable to a true IRC server
        event log, because it only records user-visible events for the time frame the user spent being connected to a certain
        channel.
        
        Instant messaging and VoIP clients often offer the chance to store encrypted logs to enhance the user's privacy. These
        logs require a password to be decrypted and viewed, and they are often handled by their respective writing application.
        Some privacy focused messaging services, such as Signal, record minimal logs about users, limiting their information to
        connection times.
